An External Tracker for the [Octopath 2 Key Item Randomizer](https://github.com/MarvinXLII/OT2R). Requires .net 8.

The Button to the bottom left of each picture is to track the number of times you have checked a given key item.
The Button to the bottom right is for tracking the number of times you have received it.

Most Story items that are accessible at the same time (think Scholar & Merchant 1 Purchases / Osvald 4 Info) are grouped into a single item with increased count.

If a key item can not be increased checks wise, it is because it is implicitly checked with something else (e.g. Ochette Beasts are implicitly checked by their Chapters)
